Project Flow Steps - Power BI
This project uses the Pizza Dataset from Maven Pizza Challenge.

1.	Data Gathering: Collect the data required for the project, including the Pizza Dataset from Maven Pizza Challenge.
2.	Data Cleaning / Data Transformation: Clean and transform the data as necessary to prepare it for use in the project. This may include removing duplicates, fixing data types, and merging data from different sources.
3.	Data Modelling: Create a data model that will be used to build the Power BI report. This may include creating relationships between tables, creating calculated columns, and creating hierarchies.
4.	UI (Power View Reports): Build the user interface for the report, including creating visualizations such as charts, tables, and maps. This step may also include creating dashboards to display multiple visualizations in a single view.
5.	DAX Functions: Use Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create custom calculations and measures that will be used in the report. This may include creating calculated columns, creating calculated tables, and using DAX functions to manipulate data.
6.	Enhance UI: Add additional features and functionality to the user interface as necessary, including custom themes, tooltips, and drill-through capabilities.
